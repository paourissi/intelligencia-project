## Things to consider

- No need to use Redux as there wasnt any complex state management.
- Functional Lodash was used to avoid boilerplate code.
- Bonus step is done also, you can check it by selected a number of pages from the dropdown in pagination component.
- [React-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) was used to optimize response times.
